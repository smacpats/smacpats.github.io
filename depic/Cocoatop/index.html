		<description>This is in my repo until the developer submits it into another public one. Works on iOS 11.0-11.3.1.
 
After installation of cocoatop, this may disappear from my repo and magically morph into another package that doesn’t seem to have a repo, and despite being called “cocoatop”, otherwise looks like a different package. It’s normal.
 
This doesn’t require a respring to work, just open cocoatop and go.
